We aim to create a chatbot that can answer questions using a Reddit knowledge
base.

Step by step:
1. Get a question from the user.
2. Look for Reddit at relevant posts that are similar to the question given by
the user.
3. Gather all comments in the comment sections of relevant post.
4. Return a response based on the most popular type of comment

How now?
1. Get a sentence from the user.
2. Use the reddit search function to get the most relevant post, using the
input sentence as search words.
3. Return the most upvoted comment.

How next?
